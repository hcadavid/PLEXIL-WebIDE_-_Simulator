This project requires a working copy of [PLEXIL 4.0.1](https://sourceforge.net/projects/plexil/files/latest/download) installed and configured in the server, with a custom plexil adapter.

The SoC code used to run the plan in the physical rover (the six-wheel rover with a command-based RS-232 interface described in the paper), is available at https://bitbucket.org/hcadavid/soc-plexil-hardware-adapter/src/master/
